# Condition Builder and Space Handling Improvements

## Overview

Comprehensive improvements to the Condition Builder system and global space handling in `TextInputWithMentions`. These changes significantly enhance user experience, code maintainability, and data integrity across the CMS.

## Part 1: Condition Builder Refactor

### Major Architecture Change: CreatableSelectField Integration

**Problem Solved**: Replaced a complex lock/unlock toggle system with the existing `CreatableSelectField` component, providing much better UX for handling custom variables.

#### Before: Complex Toggle System

The original implementation used a convoluted toggle system with:
- Manual mode switching (locked/unlocked)
- Complex state management (3 state variables)
- Separate render paths for dropdown vs text input
- Custom variables not visible in dropdown when loading

```typescript
function CreatableFieldSelector() {
    const [isCustomMode, setIsCustomMode] = useState(false);
    const [userToggledMode, setUserToggledMode] = useState(false);
    const [lastValue, setLastValue] = useState(value);

    // Complex useEffect to auto-detect mode
    useEffect(() => { /* 30+ lines of mode detection logic */ });

    if (isCustomMode) {
        return <TextInputWithMentions /> with unlock icon;
    } else {
        return <Select /> with lock icon;
    }
}
```

#### After: CreatableSelectField

```typescript
function CreatableFieldSelector() {
    const fieldConfig = {
        options: options.map(opt => ({ value: opt.name, text: opt.label })),
        multiSelect: false,
        creatable: true,
        searchable: true,
        separator: ' '
    };

    return (
        <CreatableSelectField
            config={fieldConfig}
            value={value}
            onChange={changeHandler}
            placeholder="Select field or add custom"
            dataVariables={dataVariables}
        />
    );
}
```

### Benefits Achieved

| Aspect | Before (Toggle System) | After (CreatableSelectField) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Predefined Fields** | Dropdown (locked mode) | Dropdown (always visible) |
| **Custom Variables** | Text input (unlocked mode) | "Add custom field" button |
| **Display Custom** | Not in dropdown | Green pill in dropdown |
| **Mode Switching** | Manual toggle required | Automatic based on action |
| **State Management** | 3 state variables + useEffect | None (handled by component) |
| **Lines of Code** | ~100 lines | ~20 lines |

### User Experience Flow

**Adding a New Rule:**
1. Click "Add Rule"
2. Field Selector shows dropdown with predefined fields + "Add custom field" button
3. Select predefined field OR add custom variable
4. Custom variables appear as green pills in dropdown
5. Operator selection and value editing follow same pattern

**Loading Saved Conditions:**
- Custom variables automatically display as green pills
- No more "where did my variable go?" confusion
- Can edit existing custom values directly

## Part 2: Final Integration Fixes

### Issue 1: Space Splitting in Single-Select ✅

**Problem**: Custom field values with spaces (like `{{user name}}`) were being split into multiple values instead of treated as one.

**Solution**: Differentiated handling between multi-select (CSS classes) and single-select (condition fields):

```typescript
if (config.multiSelect) {
    // Multi-select: split on spaces (CSS classes pattern)
    newVals = multiValues.split(/[\s\n]+/).filter(Boolean);
} else {
    // Single-select: treat entire input as one value
    newVals = [multiValues.trim()];
}
```

### Issue 2: UI Alignment Problems ✅

**Problem**: Fields in condition builder weren't aligned at the top, causing visual misalignment.

**Solution**: Added `alignSelf: 'flex-start'` to all field wrapper divs for consistent top alignment.

### Issue 3: Custom Field Not Auto-Selected ✅

**Problem**: When adding custom fields, they were added to the list but not automatically selected.

**Solution**: For single-select mode, replaced the value entirely instead of appending:

```typescript
if (config.multiSelect) {
    // Multi-select: add to existing values
    const uniqueNewVals = newVals.filter(val => !currentValues.includes(val));
    updatedValues = [...currentValues, ...uniqueNewVals];
} else {
    // Single-select: replace with new value (auto-select)
    updatedValues = newVals;
}
```

### Issue 4: Branch Lines Adjustment ✅

**Solution**: The `alignSelf: 'flex-start'` fix automatically resolved branch line positioning.

## Part 3: Global Space Handling Fix

### Major Architecture Change: Centralized Space Trimming

**Problem Solved**: Trailing spaces were being saved everywhere `TextInputWithMentions` was used, requiring manual `.trim()` calls in every component.

**Solution**: Fixed it once in the `TextInputWithMentions` component itself:

```typescript
export function TextInputWithMentions({ ... }: ITextInputWithMentionsProps) {
    const handleChange = (newValue: string) => {
        // Trim leading and trailing spaces but preserve middle spaces
        const trimmedValue = newValue.trim();
        onChange(trimmedValue);
    };

    return (
        <MentionEditor
            value={value}
            onChange={handleChange}  // ← Use wrapper with trimming
        />
    );
}
```

### Default Mode Improvement

**Problem**: Condition builder started in custom mode, confusing users who expected dropdown options first.

**Solution**: Changed default mode to dropdown/locked for both field selector and value editor:

```typescript
// Before: Custom mode by default
const [isCustomMode, setIsCustomMode] = useState(true);
const [isTextMode, setIsTextMode] = useState(true);

// After: Dropdown mode by default ✅
const [isCustomMode, setIsCustomMode] = useState(false);
const [isTextMode, setIsTextMode] = useState(false);
```

### Cleanup: Removed Redundant Code

Removed all manual `.trim()` calls from ConditionBuilderModal since trimming now happens automatically:

```typescript
// Before (redundant trimming)
<TextInputWithMentions
    onChange={(newValue) => changeHandler(newValue.trim())}
/>

// After (trimming happens automatically)
<TextInputWithMentions
    onChange={changeHandler}
/>
```

## Part 4: TextInputWithMentions Space Handling

### Core Issues Fixed

1. **Multiple Spaces Collapsing**: HTML collapses multiple consecutive spaces by default
2. **Automatic Space After Mentions**: Tiptap was adding trailing spaces after mention insertion
3. **Space Key Behavior**: Inconsistent handling between visual rendering and stored value
4. **HTML vs Plain Text Mismatch**: Rich text editor output didn't match plain text storage

### Technical Solution

#### CSS Changes
```css
/* Changed from pre-wrap to pre for single-line mode */
.singleLineEditor :global(.ProseMirror) {
    white-space: pre;  /* Preserves ALL whitespace exactly as typed */
    overflow-x: auto;  /* Handle long single-line text */
    overflow-y: hidden;
}
```

#### PreserveSpaces Extension
Created `PreserveSpacesExtension.ts` to monitor transactions and handle pasted content appropriately.

#### Mention Styling Improvements
```css
/* Ensure mentions don't add extra spacing */
:global(.mention-variable) {
    display: inline;
    white-space: nowrap;
    margin: 0;
}
```

### How It Works Now

**Multiple Spaces**: `"hello     world"` → renders and stores as 5 spaces
**Mentions**: `"Hello {{user_name}}"` → no automatic trailing space
**Space Key**: Immediately visible and recorded in value
**Data Integrity**: Visual rendering matches stored value 100%

### Condition Builder
- `src/app/components/cms/shared/condition-builder-modal/ConditionBuilderModal.tsx` - Major refactor and fixes
- `src/app/components/cms/shared/field-components/CreatableSelectField/CreatableSelectField.tsx` - Space handling logic

### TextInputWithMentions (Global)
- `src/app/components/shared/field-components/TextInputWithMentions.tsx` - Automatic trimming
- `src/app/components/shared/mentions/MentionEditor.tsx` - Extension integration
- `src/app/components/shared/mentions/MentionEditor.module.css` - CSS changes
- `src/app/components/shared/mentions/PreserveSpacesExtension.ts` - NEW extension

### Utilities
- `src/utils/json-logic-conversion.utils.ts` - Defense-in-depth trimming

---

## Key Principles Applied

### 1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Fixed space trimming once in `TextInputWithMentions` instead of in every consuming component.

### 2. Encapsulation
Components handle their own data normalization. Consumers don't need to know about trimming details.

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
Start with dropdown mode (simple), allow users to unlock for advanced features.

### 4. Defense in Depth
Trimming happens at multiple layers:
- Component level (primary)
- JSON Logic conversion (secondary)
- Both ensure clean data

### 5. WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)
Space handling now matches user expectations - what you type is what you see and what you get.
