# Version Management System - Complete Implementation

## Summary of Changes

All requested features have been implemented and integrated with the new backend endpoints.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Version Details Modal** ✅
**Location:** `src/app/components/cms/page-versions/version-details-modal/VersionDetailsModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- View complete version metadata
- Version name, number, dates (created, published)
- Creator information
- Description and tags from metadata
- Copy version ID to clipboard
- Quick actions: Publish, Compare, Delete
- Protection: Published versions cannot be deleted
- Professional modal design with Mantine components

**Actions Available:**
- **View Details** - Shows all version information
- **Compare** - Opens comparison modal
- **Publish This Version** - Publish a specific saved version
- **Delete** - Remove unpublished versions (with confirmation)

---

### 2. **Backend API Integration** ✅

#### New Endpoints Added to `src/config/api.config.ts`:
```typescript
ADMIN_PAGE_VERSIONS_COMPARE_DRAFT: (pageId, versionId) =>
    `/admin/pages/${pageId}/versions/compare-draft/${versionId}`,

ADMIN_PAGE_VERSIONS_HAS_CHANGES: (pageId) =>
    `/admin/pages/${pageId}/versions/has-changes`,
```

#### New API Methods in `src/api/admin/page-version.api.ts`:
```typescript
// Compare current draft with published version
compareDraftWithVersion(pageId, versionId, format)

// Fast check for unpublished changes (hash-based)
hasUnpublishedChanges(pageId)
```

---

### 3. **Automatic Draft vs Published Comparison** ✅
**Location:** `src/app/components/cms/page-versions/auto-version-comparison/AutoVersionComparison.tsx`

**Updated to use new backend endpoint:**
- No longer requires draft version ID
- Automatically compares current draft with published version
- Uses `/admin/pages/{pageId}/versions/compare-draft/{versionId}` endpoint
- Shows side-by-side diff with word-level highlighting
- Refresh button to reload comparison
- Loading and error states
- Only shows when published version exists

**How it works:**
1. Backend fetches current draft structure
2. Compares with published version
3. Generates HTML diff on server
4. Frontend displays formatted comparison

---

### 4. **Unpublished Changes Detection** ✅

#### New Hook: `src/hooks/useUnpublishedChanges.ts`
```typescript
useUnpublishedChanges(pageId)
```

**Features:**
- Fast hash-based comparison (< 50ms)
- Polls every 30 seconds for changes
- Returns: `has_unpublished_changes`, `current_published_version_id`
- Automatic caching via React Query

#### Integrated into UI:
**Location:** `src/app/components/cms/page-versions/version-management/VersionManagement.tsx`

**Visual Indicators:**
- **"Unpublished Changes" badge** (yellow, with alert icon) in status header
- Only shows when:
  - Page has a published version
  - Current draft differs from published version
- Updates automatically every 30 seconds

---

### 5. **Version Comparison Functionality** ✅

**Components:**
- **VersionDetailsModal** - Compare button in version details
- **VersionHistoryList** - Compare icon on each version
- **VersionComparisonViewer** - Full-featured diff viewer modal

**Comparison Features:**
- Compare any two saved versions
- Compare draft with published (automatic)
- Multiple diff formats (side-by-side, unified, JSON patch, summary)
- Word-level highlighting
- Responsive design

---

### 6. **Updated Version History List** ✅
**Location:** `src/app/components/cms/page-versions/version-history-list/VersionHistoryList.tsx`

**Enhanced Actions:**
- **View** (👁️) - Opens version details modal
- **Publish** (✓) - Publish this version (unpublished versions only)
- **Compare** (🔀) - Compare with other versions
- **Delete** (🗑️) - Delete version (unpublished versions only)

**Visual Improvements:**
- Clear "PUBLISHED" badge (green, filled, with check icon)
- Gradient background for published version
- Better hover states
- Professional action buttons

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Performance
- **Fast Change Detection**: < 50ms hash comparison
- **Polling**: 30-second intervals for change detection
- **Caching**: React Query manages all API caching
- **Lazy Loading**: Version details loaded on demand

### Data Flow
```
Page Edit → hasUnpublishedChanges() → Badge Updates
Click View → getVersion() → Modal Opens
Click Compare → compareDraftWithVersion() → Diff Display
Click Publish → publishSpecificVersion() → Cache Invalidation → UI Refresh
```

### Cache Management
All mutations properly invalidate and refetch:
- `page-versions` cache
- `page-details` cache
- `adminPages` cache
- Immediate refetch ensures UI updates instantly
