## ⚠️ CONCERNING COMPONENTS

### ⚠️ PageInspector

**Render Count:** 12
**Average Render Time:** 20.78ms
**Total Render Time:** 249.36ms
**Last Changed Props:** page

**Current Props Structure:**
```json
{
  "pageId": "number",
  "isConfigurationPage": "boolean",
  "page": "object"
}
```

#### 📝 Why Did You Update - Detailed Change Log

This shows exactly what changed, when, and the before/after values:

**Render #2** (15s ago):
- `page` changed:
  - **From:** undefined
  - **To:** {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home","name":"Home Page"}

**Render #3** (14s ago):
- `page` changed:
  - **From:** {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home","name":"Home Page"}
  - **To:** {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home","name":"Home Page"}
  - ⚠️ **ISSUE:** Objects are equal but references differ (needs memoization)

**Render #4** (13s ago):
- `page` changed:
  - **From:** {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home","name":"Home Page"}
  - **To:** {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home","name":"Home Page"}
  - ⚠️ **ISSUE:** Objects are equal but references differ (needs memoization)

**Render #5** (12s ago):
- `page` changed:
  - **From:** {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home","name":"Home Page"}
  - **To:** {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home","name":"Home Page"}
  - ⚠️ **ISSUE:** Objects are equal but references differ (needs memoization)

... (more renders showing the same pattern)

**Analysis:**
- ⚠️ `page` changed on **EVERY render** (11/12) - Likely not memoized!

### ⚠️ SectionInspector

**Render Count:** 12
**Average Render Time:** 22.49ms
**Total Render Time:** 269.88ms
**Last Changed Props:** pageId, sectionId

**Current Props Structure:**
```json
{
  "pageId": "number",
  "sectionId": "number"
}
```

#### 📝 Why Did You Update - Detailed Change Log

This shows exactly what changed, when, and the before/after values:

**Render #2** (15s ago):
- `pageId` changed:
  - **From:** null
  - **To:** 5

**Render #3** (14s ago):
- `sectionId` changed:
  - **From:** null
  - **To:** 42

**Render #4** (13s ago):
- `pageId` changed:
  - **From:** 5
  - **To:** 5
  - ⚠️ **ISSUE:** Same value, different reference (not memoized!)

**Render #5** (12s ago):
- `pageId` changed:
  - **From:** 5
  - **To:** 5
  - ⚠️ **ISSUE:** Same value, different reference (not memoized!)

... (more renders)

**Analysis:**
- ⚠️ `pageId` changed frequently (10/12 renders)
- `sectionId` changed occasionally (2/12 renders)

## 🎯 How This Helps AI Diagnosis

### Before (Without Change Details):
```markdown
**Last Changed Props:** page
```
❌ AI doesn't know:
- What the old value was
- What the new value is
- If values are the same but references differ
- How often it changes

### After (With Change Details):
```markdown
**Render #3:**
- `page` changed:
  - From: {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home"}
  - To: {"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home"}
  - ⚠️ ISSUE: Objects are equal but references differ (needs memoization)

**Analysis:**
- ⚠️ `page` changed on EVERY render (11/12) - Likely not memoized!
```
✅ AI immediately knows:
- ✅ The `page` object is being recreated
- ✅ The data is the same but reference changes
- ✅ It happens on EVERY render
- ✅ **Fix needed:** Memoize the `page` prop

---

## 🔍 Automatic Issue Detection

The report automatically detects and flags common issues:

### Issue 1: Same Value, Different Reference
```
⚠️ ISSUE: Same value, different reference (not memoized!)
```
**Means:** A primitive value (number, string, boolean) is changing identity but not value. Usually caused by creating new values in render.

**Fix:** Use `useMemo` or move the value outside the render cycle.

### Issue 2: Objects Are Equal But References Differ
```
⚠️ ISSUE: Objects are equal but references differ (needs memoization)
```
**Means:** An object/array has the same content but is being recreated on every render.

**Fix:** Use `useMemo` to memoize the object:
```typescript
const memoizedPage = useMemo(() => page, [page?.id, page?.keyword]);
```

### Issue 3: Changed on Every Render
```
⚠️ `page` changed on EVERY render (11/12) - Likely not memoized!
```
**Means:** This prop changes on almost every render, causing cascading re-renders.

**Fix:** Find where the prop comes from and add proper memoization.

## 📈 Change Frequency Analysis

The report includes automatic analysis of how often each prop changes:

| Pattern | Meaning | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Changed on EVERY render** | 🔥 Critical - Not memoized | Fix immediately |
| **Changed frequently (>50%)** | ⚠️ Concerning - Likely issue | Fix soon |
| **Changed occasionally (<50%)** | ✅ Normal - Probably OK | Monitor |

## 💡 Example AI Diagnosis

**With this enhanced report, AI can now say:**

> "I found the issue! Your `PageInspector` component is rendering 12 times because the `page` prop is being recreated on every render in the parent component.
>
> Looking at the change log, I can see that renders #3-12 all show the same `page` object data (`{"id_pages":5,"keyword":"home"}`), but React is treating them as different objects because the reference changes.
>
> The fix is in `src/app/admin/pages/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` line 88-95. You need to memoize the `selectedPage` value to prevent it from creating a new object reference on every render.
>
> Here's the fix:
> ```typescript
> const selectedPage = useMemo(() => {
>     if (!pages || !keyword) return null;
>     const allPages = flattenPages(pages);
>     return allPages.find(p => p.keyword === keyword) || null;
> }, [pages, keyword]); // Only recalculate when pages or keyword change
> ```
>
> This will reduce your renders from 12 to 2-3."

**Before the enhancement**, AI could only guess based on render counts.  
**After the enhancement**, AI has concrete evidence and can provide exact fixes!

function MyComponent(props) {
    useRenderMonitor('MyComponent', props);  // ← Tracks renders AND prop changes
    useWhyDidYouUpdate('MyComponent', props); // ← Logs to console
    useMountMonitor('MyComponent');          // ← Tracks mount/unmount
    
    // Your component code...
}

## 🎓 Understanding the Report

### Render Numbers
```
**Render #1** - Initial mount
**Render #2** - First update (often data loading)
**Render #3+** - Subsequent updates (investigate if many)
```

### Timestamps
```
(just now)  - Within 1 second
(5s ago)    - 5 seconds ago
(2m ago)    - 2 minutes ago
```

### Value Representations
```
undefined           - Prop doesn't exist yet
null               - Prop is explicitly null
[Function]         - Prop is a function
[Complex Object]   - Object too complex to stringify
[Circular]         - Object has circular references
{"key":"value"}    - Regular object (stringified)
```

## 📊 Report Size

The enhanced report includes the **last 20 prop changes** per component, which typically means:

- **Without issues:** ~500-1000 lines
- **With issues:** ~1500-3000 lines
- **Multiple components:** Can grow larger

The report is optimized for AI reading, with clear structure and markdown formatting.
