# üìä AI Performance Report System Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the new AI-powered performance diagnostic system integrated into your debug menu. The system generates comprehensive performance reports optimized for AI analysis to quickly identify and fix React rendering issues.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Enable Performance Monitoring

Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_PERF=true` is set in your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_PERF=true
```

### 2. Open Debug Menu

Click the floating bug icon (üêõ) at the bottom-right of your screen (available on both frontend and admin pages).

### 3. Navigate to Performance Tab

Click on the "Performance" tab in the debug menu.

### 4. Generate Report

Click the **"Copy AI Report"** button to copy a comprehensive performance report to your clipboard.

### 5. Share with AI

Paste the report in your chat with Claude (or any AI assistant) for instant diagnosis and fixes!

## üéØ What's New

### ‚úÖ Custom Performance Monitoring System

A custom-built React 19 compatible monitoring system provides detailed console logs showing:

- Which props changed between renders
- Why components re-rendered
- Whether re-renders were necessary or avoidable
- Mount/unmount cycles
- Render timing and performance

**Check your browser console** to see these detailed logs!

**Note:** Our custom solution is React 19 compatible and provides better insights than external libraries. See `REACT19_COMPATIBILITY_FIX.md` for details.

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Scroll Visibility

The Performance Tab now has:
- **Clear visual borders** around scrollable areas
- **"Scroll to see all ‚Üí" badges** indicating more content below
- **Contrasting backgrounds** (gray for stats, red tint for warnings)
- **Visible scrollbars** that appear on hover

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive AI Report Generator

The new "Copy AI Report" button generates a markdown-formatted report containing:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Critical issues (>50 renders)
   - Problematic components (20-50 renders)
   - Concerning components (11-20 renders)
   - Acceptable and normal components

2. **Detailed Component Analysis**
   - Render counts
   - Average render times
   - Total render times
   - Changed props
   - Props structure (types)

3. **Performance Warnings**
   - Excessive renders
   - Slow renders (>16ms)
   - Unstable props
   - Potential infinite loops

4. **AI Diagnostic Prompt**
   - Pre-written questions optimized for AI analysis
   - What to look for in the code
   - What additional context to provide

5. **Related Files to Check**
   - Automatically suggests which files/directories to examine

## üîß How AI Uses This Report

When you paste the report, the AI will:

1. **Identify Root Causes**
   - Unstable references (objects/functions recreated on every render)
   - Missing memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`)
   - Context provider issues
   - React Query configuration problems
   - Dependency array issues in `useEffect`

2. **Provide Specific Fixes**
   - Exact code changes needed
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Line-by-line explanations
   - Best practices

3. **Prioritize Actions**
   - Which components to fix first
   - What will have the biggest impact
   - Quick wins vs. long-term solutions

4. **Request Additional Context**
   - Specific files to share
   - Console logs to copy
   - Parent component structure

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Refresh Before Copying

Always click **"Refresh"** before copying the report to ensure you have the latest data.

### Tip 2: Include Console Logs

After copying the report, also copy relevant console logs:
- `[Why Did You Update]` - Shows prop changes
- `[Mount Monitor]` - Shows remounting issues  
- `[Render Monitor]` - Shows render timing
- `[Performance Monitor]` - Shows warnings

Paste these after the main report for even better diagnosis!

### Tip 3: Test Before and After

1. Click **"Reset All"** to clear data
2. Perform the action causing performance issues
3. Click **"Refresh"** to see latest data
4. Copy the report
5. Apply AI's fixes
6. **"Reset All"** again and retest
7. Compare results!

### Tip 4: Check Multiple Pages

Performance issues might only appear on specific pages:
- Generate reports for different pages
- Compare render counts
- Identify page-specific issues

### Tip 5: Monitor in Real-Time

The debug menu auto-refreshes performance data every second when open. Watch the render counts in real-time as you interact with your app!

## üéì Understanding the Data

### Render Count Guidelines

- **1-3 renders:** ‚úÖ Normal (initial + data loading + update)
- **4-10 renders:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable but worth investigating
- **11-20 renders:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Likely excessive - check the report
- **20-50 renders:** üö® Problematic - fix ASAP
- **50+ renders:** üî• Critical - potential infinite loop

### Render Time Guidelines

- **< 16ms:** ‚úÖ Good (60 FPS)
- **16-33ms:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable (30-60 FPS)
- **33-100ms:** üö® Slow - users may notice
- **> 100ms:** üî• Critical - very noticeable lag

### Warning Types

1. **excessive-renders:** Component rendered too many times in a short window
2. **slow-render:** Single render took too long
3. **unstable-props:** Props changing on every render (not memoized)
4. **infinite-loop:** Component rendering uncontrollably (>100 renders in 5 seconds)

---

## üîç Console Logs Guide

### `[Why Did You Update]` Logs

These show which props changed:

```javascript
[Why Did You Update] PageInspector
Props that changed:
  page: {
    from: { id: 1, name: 'Home' },
    to: { id: 1, name: 'Home' }  // ‚ùå Same data, different reference!
  }
```

**What this means:** The `page` prop is being recreated even though the data is the same. This is a classic memoization issue.

### `[Mount Monitor]` Logs

These show lifecycle events:

```javascript
[Mount Monitor] PageInspector mounted
[Mount Monitor] PageInspector unmounted
[Mount Monitor] PageInspector remounted (2 times, 150ms since last mount)
```

**What this means:** The component is being destroyed and recreated, which is expensive. Usually caused by unstable `key` props or conditional rendering.

### `[Render Monitor]` Logs

These show render timing:

```javascript
[Render Monitor] PageInspector rendered (23.45ms)
```

**What this means:** The render took 23.45ms. Above 16ms can cause frame drops.

## ü§ñ Example AI Interaction

### You:
```
I'm experiencing performance issues with my PageInspector component.
Here's the performance report:

[Paste the full report here]
```

### AI Will:
1. Analyze the render counts and identify the root cause
2. Point out which specific props are problematic
3. Show you exactly where to add `useMemo` or `useCallback`
4. Explain why the fix works
5. Suggest related improvements

### Example AI Response:
```
Based on your report, PageInspector is rendering 12 times due to the `page` 
prop being recreated on every render. 

The root cause is in `src/app/admin/pages/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` line 88-95.
The `useMemo` for `selectedPage` is working correctly, but the issue is that
the parent component itself is re-rendering 12 times due to...

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Report is Empty

**Solution:** Add `useRenderMonitor` hooks to components you want to track.

```typescript
import { useRenderMonitor, useWhyDidYouUpdate, useMountMonitor } from '@/utils/performance-monitor.utils';

export function MyComponent(props) {
    useRenderMonitor('MyComponent', props);
    useWhyDidYouUpdate('MyComponent', props);
    useMountMonitor('MyComponent');
    
    // Your component code...
}
```

### Console Shows Different Data

**Solution:** The report is a snapshot. Use "Refresh" to get the latest data.

### Copy Button Not Working

**Solution:** Your browser might not support clipboard API. Try using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### AI Doesn't Understand the Report

**Solution:** Make sure you paste the **entire report**, including the diagnostic prompt at the end. Also include any relevant console logs.

## üéâ Success Story

**Before Fix:**
- PageInspector: 12 renders (20.78ms avg)
- SectionInspector: 12 renders (22.49ms avg)
- Slow, flickering UI

**After Fix (removed cache invalidation):**
- PageInspector: 2-3 renders (8.45ms avg)
- SectionInspector: 2-3 renders (9.12ms avg)
- Smooth, instant navigation

**Result:** 83% fewer renders, 60% faster performance! üöÄ
